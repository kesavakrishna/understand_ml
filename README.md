i understood the purpose of the pla and how it works, but am still confused on the mathematical theorems and how its derived. maybe i have to brush up on my math fundamentals and put more effort in understanding them, otherwise ill still keep struggling. but i will prioritize the algorithms part first, will do the mathematical theorems after a certain point
